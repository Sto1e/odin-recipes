        <H2>Descrition</H2>

        <p>These baked ribs are so easy — all you need is time.</p>
        <p>We bake the ribs before adding any sauce, and then when baked, we brush on our favorite barbecue sauce.</p>


        <H2>Ingridients</H2>

        <ul>
            <li>2 to 2 1/2 pounds baby back pork ribs
</li>
            <li>Salt and black pepper</li>

        </ul>


        <H2>Steps</H2>

<ol>

<li>Heat oven to 275° Fahrenheit (135C).
    
    <li>If the ribs still have the thin membrane covering the back of the rack, remove it.</li>
<li>Season both sides of the ribs with a generous amount of salt and pepper. If you are using a spice rub, add season the ribs with it now.</li>
<li>Place the ribs, meat-side up, into a large roasting pan or rimmed baking sheet.</li>
<li>Cover the pan or baking sheet tightly with aluminum foil, and then bake until the meat falls easily from the bones, 2 ½ to 3 ½ hours.</li>


</ol>
